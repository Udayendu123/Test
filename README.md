This program takes the weekly budget as input and the dictionary of newspapers with their respective daily price, and returns all possible combinations of newspaper subscriptions that meet that budget. The program uses a greedy algorithm to iterate through the newspapers and select those that are within budget. Finally, it returns a list of tuples, each containing a combination of newspaper subscriptions that meet the budget.
